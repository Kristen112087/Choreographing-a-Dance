    <h2>Song Choice</h2>
    <p>If you want to Choreograph your own line dance, the first step is to pick your music!</p>
    <p>It's all about what appeals to you, this is your dance, pick whatever  you want!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Spotify</li>
        <li>Search title or genre you like</li>
        <li>pick one that has a good beat that you like</li>
    </ol>

    <hr />

    <h2>Next step is to count out your dance</h2>
    <p>You want to count the number of beats, so you can have the correct number of steps in your dance.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Get pencil and paper</li>
        <li>Start song</li>
        <li>Count each 8 count as 1 mark on your paper</li>
        <li>When there is a break in the song or the chorus starts, start a new line</li>
        <li>When the song is done, you now have the number of counts in the song</li>
    </ol>
